A first effor toward the reproduction of work done here: http://earlybreast.becklab.org/images

Needs:
 * Validation of the segmentation wrt. to those avaialable online
 * Other patch metric computations (easy)
 * ML downstream processing
 
Things that would be cool:
 * Per-patch image highlighting of large diagnostic contributors
 * Consider tools in cellprofiler module
 * Elimination of edge-patch effects (or at least bounding of them)
